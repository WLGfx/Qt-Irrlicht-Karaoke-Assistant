# Qt-Irrlicht-Karaoke-Assistant
View on extended screen, change background and sort singers queue.

When I used to run karaokes I got bored of just switching the desktop background for images to display.

So I came up with this. The backgrounds are displayed in 3D and a song list can be created for singers, that will also be displayed on the screen. I also added to it a 3D object loader which would display 3D animated objects.
